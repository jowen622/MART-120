        I'm not sure what kind of story I'm supposed to type up but I'll tell the story of my dog. I got my dog just over a year ago in September of 2020.
        I've been looking into getting a dog for years and decided that the time was right. I was looking at Craigslist everyday but the right dog just didn't
        seem to show up yet. Until! One day! A 4 month old yorkie with the cutest smiled showed up. I immediately messaged his owner and later that day went to the family's
        house with my friends to see what the pup was like and if he was the one. When we showed up the garage door opened and he came running right up to me,
        so excited. I talked with his owner and came to the realization that this pup was not in a good home and needed to get him out right away. The most
        troubling thing that I was told was that he was kept in his kennel in the garage almost all day, only being let out to eat and go to the bathroom. But his
        owner and family were gone for most of the day and sometimes he would be in his kennel for 16 hours a day. There were other red flags but that one
        was the worst. I immediately decided that I was taking him.
        His first night he was so nervous and unsure of everything, which makes sense because everything was new to him. I took everything very slow with him
        and helped him grow into the dog he is today. There are still some signs of the abuse he went through that I notice from time to time, and even though I've
        tried many things he still is terrified to go into his kennel. But we've made amazing progress together and I'm so happy that he is with me now. His name is
        Midge and he's my boy.
